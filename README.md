# A Yen for the Future
The purpose of this homework is to use time-series tools that we have learned to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.


## `Time-Series Forecasting:`
Use the results of the time series analysis and modeling to answer the following questions:

* Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

* Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

* Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?


## `Linear Regression Forecasting:`

Use the results of the linear regression analysis and modeling to answer the following question:

* Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?
